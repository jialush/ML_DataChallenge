# ML_DataChallenge
In the project, you are required to predict the flight delays.

- Please read the test.csv file and prepare/generate features for model traning and testing.

- Please build a regression/ machine learning/ deep learning model to predict how many minutes a flight will be delayed. The model's performance will be evaluated on mean absolute percent error (MAE).

- Please explain the findings effectively to technical and non-technical audiences using comments and visualizations, if appropriate.
